# Brain_tumor_classification

A brain tumor refers to the abnormal growth of cells in the brain and nearby areas like nerves, membranes, and glands. 
Brain Tumor is a life-threatening disease, which makes it necessary to develop accurate and reliable artificial intelligence diagnosis models and take early action.
Brain tumor classification using CNN is a popular Deep Learning technique that has shown promising results in accurately identifying different types of tumors. 
I have tried to evaluate and compare three Deep Learning models for Brain Tumor Classification.
The deep learning models used were - CNN, ResNet50, VGG16.
